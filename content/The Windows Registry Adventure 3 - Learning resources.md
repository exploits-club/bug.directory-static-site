## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) makes an appearance for the third time in a row, this time with the **third installment in the running "Windows Registry Adventures series ."** As a quick recap, the **series started with an introduction**, which explained the target subsystem, the research P0 performed, and the resulting bugs. **The team then followed it up with a post outlining a brief history of the Registry.** The **newest post in the series looks specifically at learning resources and tools one should use to get up to speed on the Registry.** It serves as an excellent blueprint for someone looking to replicate P0's work and, more broadly, shows a methodology for researching and learning about a specific subsystem on a target.
