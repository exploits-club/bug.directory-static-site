## Exploits Club Summary:
> A few months ago, Trail of Bits introduced their testing handbook with it's first chapter on Semgrep. This month, they have gone ahead and added a second chapter detailing CodeQL. This is a perfect place to get started with CodeQL or sharpen your skills if you have already had it in your toolkit for a while now.
