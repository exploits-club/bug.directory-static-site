## Exploits Club Summary:
> Following up their 3 part blog series about Full Chain Baseband exploits from late last year, [**Taszk**](https://taszk.io/?ref=blog.exploits.club) **is back with more baseband goodies this week.** In their new post, the team explains an **exploit they developed to achieve RCE on Samsung Exynos basebands by targeting Radio Layer 2.** The post starts with some details about Layer 2 and continues on to talk about the two bugs they identified. Used in conjunction, the bugs give them a **relatively strong heap overflow primitive.** Before going into the exploitation, **the post talks through baseband heap internals, discussing the front-end and back-end allocators, as well as the classic heap exploit technique the back-end allocator is susceptible to**. It then continues onto exploitation, **walking through heap shaping and overcoming mitigations before concluding with a demo.**
