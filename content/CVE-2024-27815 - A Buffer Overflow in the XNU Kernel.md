## Exploits Club Summary:
>  [@0xjprx](https://x.com/0xjprx?ref=blog.exploits.club) just published an **overflow he found in the XNU kernel.** The bug manifests due to the **mixup of two, very similar-looking variable names (`MSIZE` and `MLEN`).** Apple introduced the bug by adding a size check on `MSIZE`, which actually is the size of an entire message buffer (header and data), and not just the buffer (which would be...you guessed it....`MLEN`). **The post includes a crash PoC and the patch released by Apple.**
