## Exploits Club Summary:
> [The Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/?ref=blog.exploits.club) has been under fire recently for just all around sucking - from a product, technology, and security point of view (the holy trinity!). [@David3141593](https://x.com/David3141593?ref=blog.exploits.club) decided to get in on the fun this week, releasing a post about **his efforts in jailbreaking the device.** The write-up outlines the **hardware and boot process of the R1 before detailing how he broke the root of trust via the USB bootloader mode, which accepts unsigned Download Agents.** From there, he could **backdoor the device with** [**flashable-android-rootkit**](https://github.com/ng-dst/flashable-android-rootkit?ref=blog.exploits.club) **and dig into the device's internals.** The rest of the post discusses his findings so far, both in terms of data privacy and technical claims from the Rabbit team.
