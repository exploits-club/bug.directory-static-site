## Exploits Club Summary:
>   It wouldn't be a newsletter these days if we didn't have a [Theori](https://theori.io/?ref=blog.exploits.club) post, and they are back with the **4th part of their N-day full chain.** The posts up to this point have detailed compromising the browser and privesc-ing on the virtual host. Now the team discusses **the first step in escaping from the virtual machine to the host.** If you have read the other 3 posts up to this point, you will be familiar with the format of this one, but the explanation walks you through the **necessary background knowledge on Virtual Bluetooth devices and USB Request Blocks. It then jumps into the vulnerability (and a botched patch resulting in a variant) followed by some notes on exploitation.**
