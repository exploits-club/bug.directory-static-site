## Exploits Club Summary:
> [**ZDI**](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) hosted a blog post from Cody Gallagher, in which he discussed the **OOB write bug he used to pop VirtualBox in P20.** The **core bug stems from an incorrect calculation of a start address, which results in the ability to write outside of a fixed size buffer.** The exploit leverages this bug to **disable the critical sections and trigger a race condition.** The post does a fantastic job detailing all the specifics, including code, and digging into the VB internals - give it a read!
