## Exploits Club Summary:
> NCCGroup (more specifically, [@alexjplaskett](https://x.com/alexjplaskett?ref=blog.exploits.club) and [@robHerrera_](https://x.com/robHerrera_?ref=blog.exploits.club)) released a **40-page whitepaper** ahead of their BlackHat talk **covering their exploitation of 2 Sonos speakers.** The paper first walks through the **stack overflow identified in the Sonos One's wireless kernel driver while handling WPA2 handshake negotiations.** They discuss how they **narrowed the attack surface, identified and triggered the bug, complications with exploitation and post-exploitation techniques to capture audio on the victim device covertly.** The second part of the paper talks through **3 bootloader vulnerabilities** which not only **allow for persistent code execution**, but also the **ability to dump the OTP data to decrypt future firmware updates**. The paper is well written and extremely thorough, we highly recommend everyone give it read.
