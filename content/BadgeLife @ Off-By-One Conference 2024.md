## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Star Labs](https://starlabs.sg/?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a post this week detailing the Off-By-One conference badge. The post looks at **how the badge was designed** before jumping into the **hardware CTFs hidden in its little octopus layers.** The CTF ranged in difficulty, **starting with just checking the USB string descriptor and going all the way up to some basic voltage glitching.** The write-up serves as an official solution to all six challenges and could spark some inspiration or learning if you are getting into hardware hacking.
