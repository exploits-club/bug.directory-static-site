## Exploits Club Summary:
> Now we weren't originally planning to include this write-up, since as the post notes **"in the vulnerability research world, you typically find [XXEs], report them, and forget about them."** However, **the post _also_ notes, "this is one of the craziest XXEs that I have ever seen",** and so we would be doing you a disservice not to bring it to your attention. The core issue stems from a prohibition **check being performed _after_ the parameter entries have been processed**, **allowing for an Out-Of-Band XXE**. The post then goes into exploitation and a nice demo.
