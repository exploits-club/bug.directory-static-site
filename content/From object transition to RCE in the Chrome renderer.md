## Exploits Club Summary:
>  Be honest with us...**is the last** [**@mmolgtm**](https://x.com/mmolgtm?ref=blog.exploits.club) **write-up still in your backlog?** Before you could even find the time to read about his last [v8 bug and exploit](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/attack-of-the-clones-getting-rce-in-chromes-renderer-with-duplicate-object-properties/?ref=blog.exploits.club), **he's already found and exploited another one.** Makes you question your career path, doesn't it? Anyyyyways you can wipe away those tears with this sweet type-confusion blog post. As usual with his posts, we start with an **overview of object map and map transitions in v8**, so no major browser pre-reqs are required. After that, the post goes over the vulnerability which **results in the confusion of a fast map and a dictionary map and discusses how that can be leveraged into arbitrary read/write within the v8 heap.** Finally, the post rounds off with a **V8 sandbox escape,** courtesy of a type confusion in a Blink object via the arbitrary heap write. Don't worry, by the time you read this one he will have probably dropped a new GPU bug.
