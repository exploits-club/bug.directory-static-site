## Exploits Club Summary:
> Sticking to the Microsoft theme, [@KeyZ3r0](https://twitter.com/KeyZ3r0?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a post this week discussing a vuln he discovered, exploited and reported in **Windows Telephony Server.** The **UAF** vuln is relatively straight forward, in which there is no check to see if an object being freed is owned by the context handle. The write-up then details the **Heap Fengshui used to exploit the vuln, including a nice XFG bypass.**
