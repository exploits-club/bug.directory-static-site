## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@GabrielLandau](https://x.com/GabrielLandau?ref=blog.exploits.club)'s talk from BlueHat IL 2024 was just released on YouTube, in which he **discusses a "previously unnamed vulnerability class" in Windows.** The talk starts by **recapping some of the research Gabriel had previously done and presented at BlackHat**, in which he could jump from Admin to Kernel due to false file immutability. In his new research, **he takes roughly the same idea but can translate it to a different security check (security catalogs) and leverage it to load an unsigned driver from userspace.**
