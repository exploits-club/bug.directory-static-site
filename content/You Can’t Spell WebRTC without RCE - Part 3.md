## Exploits Club Summary:
>  The running Signal hacking blog series out of [Margin](https://margin.re/?ref=blog.exploits.club) has finally reached its conclusion. In this last installment, **the team reflects on the previous two posts and talks through indicators of compromise**. In particular, the post **notes some of the limitations behind the current exploit** such as using a debug build of Signal, limits on data exfiltration packets, and using a virtual device for a thrower. It then jumps into **IOCs from an interface, process, and network traffic perspective**. It's an interesting post that makes you **consider the steps behind productizing an exploit...or detecting them.**
