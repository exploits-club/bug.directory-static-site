## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@wrongbaud](https://twitter.com/wrongbaud?ref=blog.exploits.club) slides from RingZer0. The talk starts with a [**fault injection overview**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection?ref=blog.exploits.club), before **demonstrating these attacks on a STM32FX**. The research starts with typical **voltage fault injection, before moving to Electromagnetic Fault Injection**. Due to the expense of the EMFI tooling, **@wrongbaud shows how to replicate these tools cost-effectively using a PicoEMP and a 3D printer**
