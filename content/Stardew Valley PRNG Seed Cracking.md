## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Interrupt Labs](https://www.interruptlabs.co.uk/?ref=blog.exploits.club) shared a post this week walking through the process of **cracking the PRNG seed used in the Switch version of** [**Stardew Valley**](https://www.stardewvalley.net/?ref=blog.exploits.club)**.** The post is heavy on reverse engineering, first **locating the PRNG functionality by comparing the PC and Switch binary, before giving a detailed walkthrough of the code.** **The post then uses this RE to develop a seed cracker based on the random "Traveling Cart stock".** It finishes with the code **release for both a Seed Cracker and a generator.**
