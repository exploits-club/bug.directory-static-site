## Exploits Club Summary:
> Yes, yes we are late to this one. The recording was uploaded to YouTube two weeks ago and the presentation is from last year. But that doesn't make it any less fun. This talk given by [@Tihmstar](https://twitter.com/tihmstar?ref=blog.exploits.club) and [@LinusHenze](https://twitter.com/LinusHenze?ref=blog.exploits.club) **walks through the software and hardware of the Apple HomePod, before jumping into exploitation and discussing the different things you can do with a jailbroken HomePod.**
