## Exploits Club Summary:
> A new post of [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/?ref=blog.exploits.club) this week, walking through the **exploitation of** [**CVE-2022-24834**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24834?ref=blog.exploits.club), a **heap overflow affecting the Lua cjson module in Redis Servers.** The team decided to target Alpine 13.8, which uses **musl libc**, rendering exploits targeting Ubuntu and other, similar distros based on GNU libc useless. The **post dives into musl's allocator (mallocng)** before walking through the exploit. The blog is highly in-depth and leaves no stone unturned, so read it.
