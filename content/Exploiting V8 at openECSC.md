## Exploits Club Summary:
>  "CTFs don't help in the real world". Yeah, well tell that to this challenge, which requires going from a **V8 bug to shell**. The challenge from openECSC introduces some new functionality in the V8 engine via a buggy patch. After identifying the vulnerability, exploitation follows the common pattern of "read arbitrary addresses (`addrof`), create fake objects (`fakeobj`), and eventually reach arbitrary code execution." **If you are interested in getting started with V8 exploitation, this challenge and the subsequent write-up from** [**@rebane2001**](https://x.com/rebane2001?ref=blog.exploits.club) **are a great place to get your feet wet.**
