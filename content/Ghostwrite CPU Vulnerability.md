## Exploits Club Summary:
> New research published this week details a **vulnerability affecting certain RISC-V CPUs**. Specifically, the vulnerability **allows arbitrary read and write of any physical memory address.** The bug stems from **faulty instructions in the vector extension, which operate directly on physical memory.** An unprivileged attacker can use these instructions to write to any memory address with 100% reliability. One of the more interesting parts of this vulnerability was the **method of discovery used by the team, which they outline in the** [**associated paper**](https://ghostwriteattack.com/riscvuzz.pdf?ref=blog.exploits.club)**.** **The team runs the same instructions across multiple CPUs, all of which _should_ provide the same results if they are implemented to spec.** If they don't....well might be a good spot to investigate.
