## Exploits Club Summary:
> Speaking of "mitigations" and "novel exploitation," a paper released this week **demonstrating how to break MTE via speculative execution.** The team identified **two new gadgets they deemed "TikTag-v1" and "TikTag-v2,"** which can "**leak the MTE tag of an arbitrary memory address."** The team demonstrated the vulnerability on **Google Chrome and the Linux kernel via a Pixel 8 device.** The paper's second half evaluates these experiments, **discussing reliability, feasibility, and potential mitigations.**
