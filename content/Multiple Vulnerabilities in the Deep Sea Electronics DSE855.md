## Exploits Club Summary:
> [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) put out a post this week walking **through a handful of vulnerabilities reported in a communications device developed by** [**Deep Sea Electronics**](https://www.deepseaelectronics.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club)**.** These vulnerabilities are **0-days at the time of release** because Deep Sea missed the 120-day patch deadline set by ZDI. The post does a **quick overview of the device's hardware and software** before jumping into a rundown of the rather straight forward vulns...some **missing auth checks, stack overflows, and a DOS bug** just for good measure. This is your wake-up call to go buy embedded devices and get some wins.
