## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Claroty Team82](https://claroty.com/team82?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a **write-up for the first stage of their SOHO smashup exploit chain at** [**Pwn2Own 2023 Toronto**](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2023/10/23/pwn2own-toronto-2023-the-schedule?ref=blog.exploits.club)**.** This post discusses the **WAN exploit they achieved against the TP-Link ER605 router.** It starts by e**numerating the attack surface, leading to the team targeting the binary handling DDNS services on the device.** After understanding the custom protocol, the **team identified three vulnerabilities.** The first allowed them to **impersonate the DDNS server** due to symmetric encryption via a hardcoded key and no additional auth checks. After that, they **leveraged two buffer overflows, the first to leak data back to their malicious server to break ASLR and the second to pop RCE.** Part 2 should be coming to discuss pivoting to exploit the Synology BC500 IP camera.
