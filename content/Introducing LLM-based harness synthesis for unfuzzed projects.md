## Exploits Club Summary:
> **Ahhhh fuzzing and LLMs, a tale as old as 1-2 years ago.** This week OSS-Fuzz released a blog on some interesting work they are doing around automated harness creation via LLMs. **The goal is to end up with an OSS-Fuzz project, taking only a GitHub URL as input.** Magic? No, that's _the_ _power of AI, baby_. **The post wraps up with the results of the testing thus far, which includes 3 vulnerabilities found across 15 projects.**
