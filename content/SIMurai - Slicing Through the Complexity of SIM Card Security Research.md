## Exploits Club Summary:
> A new paper from [@nSinusR](https://x.com/nSinusR?ref=blog.exploits.club) [et al](https://x.com/nSinusR/status/1823712435959947476?ref=blog.exploits.club) asks the question what if a malicious SIM card was a valid attack surface? The **paper centers around the release of the team's new tool,** [**SIMurai**](https://github.com/tomasz-lisowski/simurai?ref=blog.exploits.club)**, a "versatile software SIM implementation that can be integrated into various environments for advanced testing and development."** It starts by describing the tool's design and how it implements various technical aspects of the specification. It then jumps into **the juicy security research aspects, walking through several threat models and the associated potential attacks.** Of note, the team ran a **fuzzing campaign against baseband firmware, and identified two high severity vulnerabilities.**
