## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@thatjiaozi](https://x.com/thatjiaozi?ref=blog.exploits.club) published an **interesting eBPF vulnerability on the** [**Google Security Research Github**](https://github.com/google/security-research?ref=blog.exploits.club) **repo earlier this week.** The bug itself was identified via a modified version of [buzzer](https://github.com/google/buzzer?ref=blog.exploits.club), and allows **"an attacker to trick the eBPF verifier into thinking a register has a value different from the one it takes when executing the program".** Essentially, the verifier attempts to keep track of the minimum and maximum value a specific register can hold, and this **bug allows that assumption to be broken, leading to arbitrary R/W in kernel memory.**
