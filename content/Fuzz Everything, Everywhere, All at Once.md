## Exploits Club Summary:
> This talk walks through how to fuzz binary-only targets with LibAFL and QEMU. It then introduces a new library for LibAFL which offers "APIs to hook the target using Rust". It includes a demo against an Android Library, as well as a demo showing off some built-in detections for non-memory corruption bugs, such as command injection and SQLi. If this talk sparks your interest in LibAFL like it did for us, Artedis released a [LibAFL workshop](https://www.atredis.com/blog/2023/12/4/a-libafl-introductory-workshop?ref=blog.exploits.club) earlier this month which can help bring you up to speed.
