## Exploits Club Summary:
>  [@buptsb](https://twitter.com/buptsb?ref=blog.exploits.club) and [@mistymntncop](https://twitter.com/mistymntncop?ref=blog.exploits.club) have been busy this week. They [**first released a blog post and PoC for CVE-2024-4947**](https://buptsb.github.io/blog/post/CVE-2024-4947-%20v8%20incorrect%20AccessInfo%20for%20module%20namespace%20object%20causes%20Maglev%20type%20confusion.html?ref=blog.exploits.club)**, an ITW Chrome 0-day found by Kaspersky** (which you should know about if you read last week's exploits.club). Following up, they did the same for the **second ITW Chrome 0-day in last week's security update. Both posts are worth a read, but in the end they use the same exploit technique.** [Zero Day Engineering](https://zerodayengineering.com/insights/chrome-viz-v8-wasm.html?ref=blog.exploits.club) also [**released a RCA of the bugs**](https://zerodayengineering.com/insights/chrome-viz-v8-wasm.html?ref=blog.exploits.club) should you be interested in further reading.
