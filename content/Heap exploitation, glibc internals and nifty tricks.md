## Exploits Club Summary:
> Continuing on the CTF write-ups theme, [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) walks through a **heap challenge** in their most recent blog post, **using it as an opportunity to give a detailed rundown of internals and exploitation techniques.** It offers a **primer on GLIBC malloc internals, explaining heap implementation and common exploitation techniques**. It then builds on this foundational information, walking through the **HITCON qualifiers challenge which required a combination of techniques to be solved.** If you are looking to get up to speed quickly on heap exploitation, this is a great place to start.
