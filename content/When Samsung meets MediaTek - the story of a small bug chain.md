## Exploits Club Summary:
>  We are only 2 months late to this one, but who can blame us given the amount of content [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) has continued to turn out? In this paper, the team walks through the **research they conducted against low-end Samsung devices, specifically targeting the JPEG logo parsing of the bootloader.** The first half of the post walks through the RE process, identification of a **heap overflow**, and exploitation to achieve **full control over Normal World Execution Levels 1 and 0**. It then discusses an **Odin authentication bypass**, which actually allows for the malicious JPEG to be flashed to the device. The second half of the post looks at **targeting the TEE**, and **identifies memory leak which allowed the retrieval of keystore keys once they are loaded into Secure World RAM.**
