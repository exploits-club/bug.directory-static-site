## Exploits Club Summary:
> Quarkslab makes yet another appearance in the newsletter this week for their new post on an **"Android Runtime hijacking mechanism for bytecode injection".** This post takes a look at the [**DJI Pilot application**](https://www.dji.com/downloads/djiapp/dji-pilot?ref=blog.exploits.club), and breaks down how it uses a packer to obfuscate its code. Well written and highly-detailed, this is **worth the read for anyone reversing Android apps.**
