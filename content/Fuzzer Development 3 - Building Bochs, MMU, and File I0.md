## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Two weeks ago](https://blog.exploits.club/exploits-club-weekly-newsletter-09/), we covered the [@h0mbre_'s](https://twitter.com/h0mbre_?ref=blog.exploits.club) fuzzer development blog series. This week, he is back with another installment. In the post, he walks through some **changes he's made, such as changing the syscall Infrastructure, simplifying the context-switching calling convention, introducing a new error class, and sandboxing thread-local-storage.** He then dives into **building Bochs** and handling the subsequent syscalls this introduces into the project.
