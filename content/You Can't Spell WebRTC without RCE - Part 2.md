## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Margin Research](https://margin.re/?ref=blog.exploits.club) returns with p**art 2 of the Signal security research blog series** they started last month. The new entry into the series builds on the previous, taking the **N-day vulnerability and walking through how we might go about exploiting it.** The post goes in-depth on **how we can chain a handful of leaks together to obtain addresses we will need to break ASLR and continue with exploitation.** The post also touches on the l**imitations of the emulator**, as the memory layout is not fully representative of a physical device. As such, the team pivots to [Corellium](https://www.corellium.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) before **explaining how a ROP chain can be built to obtain RCE.**
