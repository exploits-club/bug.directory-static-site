## Exploits Club Summary:
> This is an interesting post out of Google discussing **how the team approaches proposed memory safety mitigations** and their potential trade-offs in shipped products. In particular, it discusses LLVM's introduction of [C++ Buffer Hardening](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-c-buffer-hardening/65734?ref=blog.exploits.club) , and how **the RFC was evaluated and eventually adopted into Andromeda**, GCP's Network Virtualization Stack.
