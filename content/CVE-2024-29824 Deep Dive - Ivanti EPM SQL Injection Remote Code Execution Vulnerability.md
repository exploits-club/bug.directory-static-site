## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Horizon3.ai](https://www.horizon3.ai/?ref=blog.exploits.club) dropped a deep dive on [CVE-2024-29824](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29824&ref=blog.exploits.club) this week. The vulnerability is a pretty straight forward S**QL injection, where `string.Format` is used to insert an attacker controlled value into a SQL query.** The post steps through reversing a .NET application to identify the vulnerable function and then walks up the call tree to determine the best way to trigger the bug. **It then shows a payload using `xp_cmdshell` to gain RCE**. Finally, as always from these guys, it **includes some IoCs at the very end** if you happen to still be using Ivanti products at this point
