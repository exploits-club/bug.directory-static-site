## Exploits Club Summary:
> Github Security Lab released a **methodology post this week**, essentially walking through the **workflow of performing vulnerability research entirely within the Github ecosystem** (huh..convenient). The blog walks through **forking a repository, setting up CodeQL to run via Github Actions, and using Codespaces for debugging and exploitation.** While probably a bit more reasonable for for small web projects, this could come in helpful for a cursory look before fully diving into your next VR project.
