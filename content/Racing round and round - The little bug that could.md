## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@chompie](https://x.com/chompie1337?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a **write-up detailing her Pwn2Own winning,** [**Pwnie nominated**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Jdwlw-jvdBI3N6JSZZqHTmj9rvld7WvhGykvDcE5x0/edit?ref=blog.exploits.club) **bug in Windows Streaming Service.** The post not only serves as a **wonderful technical reference, walking through the logic error** which lead to the UAF, but **also takes you through the more...abstract...skills associated with good vuln research: subsystem selection, going with your gut, spotting things which are fishy, etc.** The core bug itself stems from the failure to set a certain pointer to null during an object's release, **leading to the potential re-release of the same object, causing a UAF.** The post also goes through **a retrospective to see when the bug was first introduced before concluding with the patch** (spoiler: it's not great). We are looking forward to the **next installment on exploitation!**
