## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Codean Labs](https://codeanlabs.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a post this week walking through a **format string bug in** [**Ghostscript**](https://www.ghostscript.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club), the document conversion toolkit first released in 1988. Based on the parameters of a particular output device, the author was inclined to peak at the source code and confirmed that **they were used in a format string improperly, leading to a classic vuln.** From there, the post goes into exploitation, **turning the heap-based bug into a read / write and escaping the sandbox**
