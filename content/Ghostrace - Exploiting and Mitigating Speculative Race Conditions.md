## Exploits Club Summary:
> [VUSec](https://www.vusec.net/?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a blog post with the key takeaways from their [recently released paper](https://download.vusec.net/papers/ghostrace_sec24.pdf?ref=blog.exploits.club) . The research they conducted centered around **synchronization primitives, and their behavior in speculatively executed code paths.** The team found that "**primitives implemented using conditional branches can be microarchitecturally bypassed on speculative paths using a Spectre-v1 attack**, turning all architecturally race-free critical regions into Speculative Race Conditions (SRCs), allowing attackers to leak information from the target software."
