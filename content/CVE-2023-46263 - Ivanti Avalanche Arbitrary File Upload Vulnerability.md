## Exploits Club Summary:
> "Siri play 'Kick You When You're Down' by AC/DC" is probably what someone at [Ivanti](https://www.ivanti.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) muttered to their iPhone this week. **Following the two critical vulnerabilities** [we reported on a few weeks ago](https://blog.exploits.club/exploits-club-weekly-newsletter-04/), **a** [**third vulnerability**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21893?ref=blog.exploits.club) in Ivanti's VPN app started to see [**mass exploitation** over the weekend](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/02/as-if-two-ivanti-vulnerabilities-under-explot-wasnt-bad-enough-now-there-are-3/?ref=blog.exploits.club).
