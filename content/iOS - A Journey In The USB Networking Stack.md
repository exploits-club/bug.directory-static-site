> In true Linux-enthusiast fashion, this entire post from Synactiv seems to stem from the fact that **someone was willing to reverse engineer an entire proprietary protocol just to avoid having to use a Macbook.** Anyways, the post dives into the **history of tethering and reverse tethering on iOS devices.** It then jumps into an **explanation of how the process works under the hood and discusses some of the major changes in iOS 16 and 17.**
