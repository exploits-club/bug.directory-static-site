## Exploits Club Summary:
> Back in 2022, a paper named [Fuzzware: Using Precise MMIO Modeling for Effective Firmware Fuzzing](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_scharnowski.pdf?ref=blog.exploits.club) was released and generated a bit of buzz. The general thesis was to **create a fuzzer which would be effective on bare metal firmwares by mapping the way MMIO is used** and configuring models accordingly. This week, it was [announced](https://twitter.com/ScepticCtf/status/1483931331490947073?s=20&ref=blog.exploits.club) Fuzzware and the [experiments from the paper](https://github.com/fuzzware-fuzzer/fuzzware-experiments?ref=blog.exploits.club) have been **open-sourced.**
