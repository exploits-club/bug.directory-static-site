## Exploits Club Summary:
> A fun post from last month from [@r0rt1z2](https://blog.r0rt1z2.com/hacking-a-2014-tablet-in-2024.html?ref=blog.exploits.club) discussing his **successes and failures in hacking the Amazon Fire HD6.** The write-up begins with a walkthrough of **firmware analysis, rooting the device, and accessing UART**. Roger then discusses how he **attempted to access bootROM mode, successfully achieving the mark of any good hardware hacking project...killing his first unit.** He then pivots to target the preloader, explaining how to leverage a **GCPU exploit for arbitrary memory read/write.** After failing to dump the bootROM, he decided to **upload and execute his own preloader payloads.** The post then goes on to discuss how he was able to **unlock the bootloader and craft a malicious boot image.**
