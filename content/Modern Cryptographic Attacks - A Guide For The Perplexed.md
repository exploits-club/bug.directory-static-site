## Exploits Club Summary:
> You know that guy on your CTF team that does all the crypto, and you don't understand anything he's saying, but you just let him keep doing his thing? This new post from [Checkpoint Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) is intended to close the language barrier a bit. **The post walks through a handful of modern cryptographic attacks in extreme detail, using analogies and abstractions along the way to ensure your "perplexed" mind can handle it.** It's a really cool resource; we aren't sure if there is anything else out there like it...but then again, we actively avoid crypto challenges and bugs.
