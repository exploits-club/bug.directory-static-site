## Exploits Club Summary:
> The Android Red Team gave a [presentation at OffensiveCon24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-xSM159YLI&ref=blog.exploits.club) discussing **the fuzzing work they had done against Binder, and how they leveraged the findings into an LPE.** This post serves in conjunction with that talk, providing **a nice written explanation for the root cause of the vulnerability and the associated exploitation.** The vulnerability itself **stems from a tricky error handling condition which can be manipulated to trigger a UAF.** The exploit builds on previous work done by [Blue Frost Security](https://labs.bluefrostsecurity.de/blog/2020/03/31/cve-2020-0041-part-1-sandbox-escape/?ref=blog.exploits.club), but **changes the technique slightly in order to account for changes in the** [**SLUB allocator**](https://lwn.net/Articles/229984/?ref=blog.exploits.club) **in newer kernel versions.**
