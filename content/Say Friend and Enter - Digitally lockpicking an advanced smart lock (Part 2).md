## Exploits Club Summary:
> A few weeks ago, we covered part 1 of this series, in which [Aleph Security](https://alephsecurity.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) began analysis on a smart lock, taking a look at the Android app, firmware, BLE, and other potential attack vectors. In the follow up to that post, the team **details a metric ton of vulnerabilities they identified during the next phase of their research.** This ranges from things like **protocol downgrade to "unauthenticated update leading to complete takeover."** The biggest takeaway? Don't put a Kontrol Lux Lock on your front door...or any door for that matter.
