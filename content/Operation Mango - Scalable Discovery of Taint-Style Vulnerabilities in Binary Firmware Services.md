## Exploits Club Summary:
> This paper, which was just **accepted to USINEX '24**, walks through **"MangoDFA, a novel binary data-flow analysis leveraging value analysis and data dependency analysis on binary code"**. The key idea is a **scalable way to statically analyze Linux-based IoT firmware for common bugs.** The results showed that the tool was able to both **analyze binaries quicker and find more bugs** compared to the other solutions currently available.
