## Exploits Club Summary:
> Ah the **zero-click IM RCE** - everyone's dream. This week, [Margin Research](https://margin.re/?ref=blog.exploits.club) took to their blog to start an exciting **new series revolving around security research on Signal.** The first entry takes a look at WebRTC. It starts with a **deep dive into the underlying protocols** before discussing how to set up a research environment. This involves using an iOS target phone and an Android thrower. Finally, the iOS app is **injected with vulnerabilities** [**previously discovered by Natalie Silvanovich**](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/08/exploiting-android-messengers-part-1.html?ref=margin.re) **to demonstrate how they can be triggered from the thrower.** A great primer for anyone looking to start attacking IMs, and we look forward to future entries in the series!
