## Exploits Club Summary:
> Okay, that's lots of Chrome bugs...tired of reading JS yet? Well too bad, because [Codean Labs](https://codeanlabs.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) is coming with an interesting **vulnerability in PDF.js**, the pdf viewer maintained by Mozilla and used in Firefox. The core vulnerability stems from a **missing type check in the Glyph rendering code.** For applications that embed PDF.js, the **result is an XSS on the domain the PDF is viewed. For non-sandboxed electron apps....yikes.**
