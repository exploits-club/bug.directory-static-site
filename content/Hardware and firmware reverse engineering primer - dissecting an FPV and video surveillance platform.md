## Exploits Club Summary:
> As the introduction states, this post out of [Subreption](https://subreption.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) is "not-so-short" but it is certainly full of **helpful information for those of you who are looking to get into hardware and firmware reverse engineering.** The blog's goal was to detail the **"general methodology and some specifics of both the hardware and software reverse engineering efforts" for an OEM video sensor platform.** It starts with assessing the board, then details **extracting firmware, reversing Uboot, dissecting the OS, assessing attractive targets, reversing kernel modules, and more.** This is one of the **more comprehensive posts we have seen when it comes to blackbox reversing of a hardware device**, so add it to your ever-growing reading list.
