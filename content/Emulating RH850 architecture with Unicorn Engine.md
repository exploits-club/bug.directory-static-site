## Exploits Club Summary:
> Quarkslab released a post this week discussing how they were able to to **emulate RH850 architecture with Unicorn.** The post starts with explaining what Unicorn is and some details about its implementation, before **diving into how they wrote code to generate the Intermediate Representation (IR) for RH850 instructions.** It then jumps to **adding a new CPU, initializing its callbacks, and leveraging the Unicorn Bindings**. Finally, it wraps up with **building a harness and leveraging hooks to retrieve code coverage.**
