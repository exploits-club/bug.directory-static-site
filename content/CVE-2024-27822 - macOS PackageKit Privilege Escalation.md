## Exploits Club Summary:
> A fun macOS privesc from [@khronokernel](https://twitter.com/khronokernel?ref=blog.exploits.club). The post is pretty **short and to the point, but boy is it effective.** The core idea is that P**ackageKit will load the users `.zshrc` as root, allowing malicious payloads to be embedded into it for an easy privesc.** The write-up also takes a look at Apple's fix by reversing the patch and understanding how it works.
