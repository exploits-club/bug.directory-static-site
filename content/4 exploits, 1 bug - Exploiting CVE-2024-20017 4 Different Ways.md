## Exploits Club Summary:
> Getting around various mitigations and remembering exploit strategies can be quite the challenge. Thankfully, [@hyprdude](https://x.com/hyprdude?ref=blog.exploits.club)'s most recent post should help you out. **The write-up walks through a stack overflow he found in the MediaTek MT7622/MT7915 SDK**. It gets fun, though, because **he wrote 4 different exploits, leveraging different strategies depending on the mitigations in place.** Starting with no mitigations (ROP to system, baybee), the post works up to **his working exploit for the Netgear WAX206** (NX, ASLR, PIE, full RELO). It's a banger of a post, check it out.
