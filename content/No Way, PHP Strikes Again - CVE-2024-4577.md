## Exploits Club Summary:
>  Last week [**@orange_8361**](https://x.com/orange_8361?ref=blog.exploits.club) **tweeted that PHP had fixed an RCE vulnerability** he had reported. In the tweet, he included a [short write-up with a bit more information](https://blog.orange.tw/2024/06/cve-2024-4577-yet-another-php-rce.html?ref=blog.exploits.club). That seemed enough for **the team over at** [**Watchtowr**](https://watchtowr.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club)**, who released a blog post a few hours later, complete with a full RCA and exploit.** The vulnerability itself **stems from a mix-up in the unicode handling for command line arguments**, resulting in an injection.
