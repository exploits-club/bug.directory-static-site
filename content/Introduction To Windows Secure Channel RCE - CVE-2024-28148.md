## Exploits Club Summary:
> In a new post this week, [**@vv474172261**](https://x.com/vv474172261?ref=blog.exploits.club) **shows us how a DOS bug may actually just be a skill issue.** **The post takes a look at a UAF in Windows Secure Channel (**[**CVE-2024-38148**](https://v-v.space/2024/08/19/CVE-2024-38148/?ref=blog.exploits.club)**), walking through a quick patch diff, running through an RCA, and explaining why Microsoft is wrong to think its not exploitable.** The most interesting part about the post, though, is what inspired Victor to look at the patch. Turns out, he had previously audited secure channel before and **includes some reflections on how he missed the vuln** and his takeaways moving forward.
