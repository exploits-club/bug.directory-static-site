## Exploits Club Summary:
> If you were seeing pictures of your long forgotten ex back in your photo library last week, you weren't alone. Apparently, iOS 17.5 introduced this bug for users, and it was patched out a week later in 17.5.1. [**Synacktiv**](https://www.synacktiv.com/en?ref=blog.exploits.club) **decided to investigate by comparing the two updates and doing a bit of bindiffing on the photo-related libraries.** The blog starts with obtaining the two updates and then jumps into **identifying the interesting files, diffing them, and understanding the patch.**
