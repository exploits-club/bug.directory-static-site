## Exploits Club Summary:
> Following up his post less than a week ago, [@SinSinology](https://x.com/sinsinology?ref=blog.exploits.club) is back again, this time taking a deep-dive into an auth bypass on Veeam. Similar to his first post, this one is exceptionally in-depth, **doing a complete walk-through of the authentication code-flow, before jumping into what makes it vulnerable.** In this case, the **vulnerability stems from the ability to use an attacker controlled URL to validate auth tokens,** so "we can tell "Veeam Enterprise Manager to ask our Rouge Server if the malicious token is valid or not". **Pretty cool bug, and the post wraps up with a small PoC.**
